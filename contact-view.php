          <p>
      I started working with Denise when I was 21 years old. I had no idea how to save and invest the small amount of money I had in order to create a better financial future for myself. Through the transitional years of my 20s, into a marriage and starting a family, Denise has been there every step of the way. Whenever I need to make a financial choice in my life, I know that Denise will have advice and wisdom to help me make the right decision for me and my family. She is supportive, intelligent, driven and a genuinely kind person. I feel financially and emotionally secure working with her as I continue to build the life of my dreams.

                  My husband and I have been working with John Markoff as our Investment Manager for over 20 years. We’ve always appreciated his patient advice and ability to speak plain English when discussing our investments and financial matters. When John decided to move to APEX, naturally we went with him. He explained everything clearly and the process was very simple and straight forward.
